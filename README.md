# Work Day Scheduler
A simple daily work scheduler to keep track of important tasks

## Description
This scheduler was created using Bootstrap, Jquery and moment.js for a faster and cleaner workflow through Javascript.

## Functionality
The scheduler works as follow. As the user begins their work day, they are able to input tasks for their entire day similiar to a journal scheduler. For each hour, they are able to write in their tasks in the text-area and save the tasks on the page. The tasks are then saved to local storage based on the hour of the day. 
## 
When or if the user refreshes the page, their previously saved tasks continue to show on the page and only change if the user chooses to change the tasks.
## 
As the hours go on throughout the work day, the past tasks turn to grey, the present tasks (based on the hour) turn to red and the future tasks turn to green. The time for the webpage is based off the users current location and time from their computer.
